I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of CSE](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). My research interest includes robotic perception and planning, embodied intelligence and robot vision.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yong Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yongliu) of [April Lab](https://april.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University.
